# Introduction to Kops (Kuberneties Operations)

+ To setup Kuberneties on AWS, We can use a tool called Kops
  - Kops stands for Kuberneties Operations
+ Kops allows us to production grade Kuberneties installations, upgrades and management
  - Using Kops we can start a cluster on AWS 
+ There is also a legacy tool called kube-up.sh
  - This is a simple tool to bring up a cluster, But it does not create a production ready enviornment
+ Kops only works on Linux/Mac
  - To run Kops on windows we need to boot up a linux box
+ Using vagrant we can bootup a Linux box

+ We can download Virtualbox from https://www.virtualbox.org and Vagrant from https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html (we need both).
