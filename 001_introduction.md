# Introduction to Kubernetes


#### 1. What is Kubernetes?

* Kubernetes is an open source orchestration system for Docker containers
* It let's you schedule containers on a cluster of machines
* You can run multiple containers on one machine
* You can run long running services (like web applications)
* Kubernetes will manage the state of these containers

        1. Can start container on specific nodes
        2. Kubernetes will restart the container when it gets killed
        3. Can also move one container from one node to another node
