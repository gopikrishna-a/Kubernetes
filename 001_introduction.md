# Introduction to Kubernetes


#### What is Kubernetes

* Kubernetes is an open source orchestration system for Docker containers
* It let's you schedule containers on a cluster of machines
* You can run multiple containers on one machine
* You can run long running services (like web applications)
* Kubernetes will manage the state of these containers

        -- Can start container on specific nodes
        -- Kubernetes will restart the container when it gets killed
        -- Can also move one container from one node to another node
        
* Instead of just running a few docker containers on one host manually, Kubernetes is a platform that will manage the containers for you
* Kubernetes clusters can start with one node and can go upto thousend nodes
* Some other popular docker orchestrators are:

        -- Docker Swarm
        -- Mesos

#### Kubernetes Advantages

* You can run Kubernetes anywhere:

        -- On-Premise (Own datacenter)
        -- Public (Google cloud, AWS, other clouds)
        -- Hybrid: Public and Private
        
* Highly modular so you can make changes if necessary
* Kubernetes is opensource
* Kubernetes has great community
* Kubernetes is Backed by Google
